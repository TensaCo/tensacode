# TensorCode: Machine Learning + Software Engineering + Runtime Introspection and Code Generation = Programming 2.0

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/e312dd5bba3641b0a5dafbb55b426f67)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/Limboid/tensorcode/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=Limboid/tensorcode&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

TensorCode is a framework that introduces simple abstractions and functions for encoding and decoding arbitrary python objects, differentiable programming (including differentiable control flow), and intelligent object creation / selection / other runtime code generation features. Rather than just think about the underlying mathematical objects, TensorCode's Programming 2.0 paradigm gives your brain the abstractions it needs to apply software engineering patterns including of encapsulation, abstraction, composition, design patterns, and derived concepts to your underlying problem. If youâ€™re developing a multi-modal agent, building the next generation of end-to-end differentiable cognitive architectures, or just adding magic to an existing program, TensorCode may fit right into your stack!

## TensorCode allows you to do the following

1. arbitrary object encoding, decoding, and selection
2. various code execution primitives (`if`, `while`, etc.) made differentiable
3. runtime code-generation and execution for a given objective
